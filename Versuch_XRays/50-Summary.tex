In this lab practice, we were introduced to X-ray diffraction as a method that generates knowledge of the structural features of material systems. We did this by first investigating the absorption of X-rays in an unknown metal foil. With this information, we tried to identify the material. In the following, we extracted the lattice parameter of $NaCl$ using X-ray diffraction and furthered our understanding of diffraction moving to a more complex material system in the end. Apart from the conceptual gains, we learned to operate the program \textit{Jana2006} to analyse diffraction data and generate knowledge from the data using this program. Therefore, this lab practice was a very useful time investment as we gained practice experience.
