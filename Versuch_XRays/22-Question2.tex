\section{X-Ray Interaction with Matter}\label{sec:Q2}

There are three essential ways of interaction between X-rays and matter: coherent and incoherent scattering and absorption. Elastic scattering of X-ray photons with electrons leads to coherent scattering, which produce Bragg-reflexes due to the periodicity of the lattice. Incoherent scattering arises as a result of inelastic scattering of the photons. Emitted photos therefore have a longer wavelength than the initial ones. Absorpition occurs in a process calld the inner photoelectric effect. This can be used in e.g.~photodiodes for detecting X-rays~\cite{Bohm.2021}. Due to therse interactions X-rays find a broad use in medicine, technology and science for imaging purposes, as radiotherapy or for structure analysis via X-ray diffraction~\cite{Lewis.1997}.
