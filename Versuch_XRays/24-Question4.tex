\section{Crystalls and Symmetry}\label{sec:Q4}

Crystalls can be found as whole or parts of minerals of natural products such as sugars, vitamins, proteins and many more~\cite{Bohm.2021}. They are defined as solid states which show a three dimensional periodic repitition of a pattern of atoms on a microscopic level. This pattern can be isotropic or anisotropic~\cite{Schwarzenbach.2001}. Knowing the crystal structure allows a description of its macroscopic structure and physical properties. A essential property of a crystal is its symmetry.Symmetry as such describes a periodic recurrance of a motive, not necessarily in space, but also e.g.~in time.
