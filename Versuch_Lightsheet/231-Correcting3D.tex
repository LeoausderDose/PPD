\section{Beyond 2D diffusion}

In practical measurements, particles do not only diffuse in two dimensions to remain within the light sheet. Therefore, it is
 crucial to consider the particle's disappearance and reappearance by employing a three-dimensional fit function~\cite{PhysRevE.80.031403}

\begin{equation}
    D(\vec{q} ; \Delta t)=A(\vec{q})\left[1-\exp \left(-D_m\left(q^2+q_z^2\right) \delta t\right)\right]+B(\vec{q}).
\end{equation}
