@article{Cerbino.2008,
 abstract = {We demonstrate the use of an ordinary white-light microscope for the study of the q-dependent dynamics of colloidal dispersions. Time series of digital video images are acquired in bright field with a fast camera, and image differences are Fourier analyzed as a function of the time delay between them. This allows for the characterization of the particle dynamics independent of whether or not they can be resolved individually. The characteristic times are measured in a wide range of wave vectors and the results are found to be in good agreement with the theoretically expected values for Brownian motion in a viscous medium.},

@article{Wulstein.2016,
 abstract = {Using light-sheet microscopy combined with digital Fourier methods we probe the dynamics of colloidal samples and DNA molecules. This combination, referred to as selective-plane illumination differential dynamic microscopy (SPIDDM), has the benefit of optical sectioning to study, with minimal photobleaching, thick samples allowing us to measure the diffusivity of colloidal particles at high volume fractions. Further, SPIDDM exploits the inherent spatially-varying thickness of Gaussian light-sheets. Where the excitation sheet is most focused, we capture high spatial frequency dynamics as the signal-to-background is high. In thicker regions, we capture the slower dynamics as diffusion out of the sheet takes longer.},
