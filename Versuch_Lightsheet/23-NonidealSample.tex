\section[Polydispersity and Flow]{Leaving the idealized world: Polydispersity and Flow}
\label{sec:PoldysAndFlow}

When we do experiments, we leave the ideal framework of theory. Instead, we enter the real world. For two unrealistic 
preconditions, we want to offer a solution on how to better fit the prediction to the real data.

The first aspect, that we want to take into account is the polydispersity of the 
used materials. As there can be aggregate formation in our solution, not all particles do have the same size. This changes the 
former equation from
