In this practical course, we gained valuable experiences in a variety of task fields: We prepared solutions, aligned the optics for the TA setup and carried out UV/Vis-spectroscopy and TA experiments. Hereby, the UV/Vis experiments were crucial for a general understanding of the different influences of different solvents on the measurements and some spectroscopic properties of the zinc complexes used. Using TA, we were able to determine the lifetime of the triplet states of different solutions. We found this a surprising simple approach for probing non stable excited states.
