Transient absorption spectroscopy is a powerful technique used in various scientific fields to investigate the dynamic behavior of molecules and materials. It provides valuable insights into the fast processes that occur on timescales ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds. By probing the absorption properties of a sample in an excited state, transient absorption spectroscopy gives insight into details of photoinduced phenomena, such as energy transfer, charge carrier dynamics, and molecular structural changes. This versatile method has found applications in fields as diverse as chemistry, physics, biology, materials science and photovoltaics. It enables researchers to explore fundamental processes and devise strategies for improving a wide range of technologies. In this lab practice, we explore this method with the material zinc tetraphenylporphyrin and zinc octaethylporphyrin.
