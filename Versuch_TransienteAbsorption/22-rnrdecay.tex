\section[Decay channels]{Radiative and non-radiative decay channels}
\label{sec:TheoDecayChannels}

This section explains why there are multiple ways for the exited state to relax.

As explained in \cref{sec:AbsEmiFlourPhos}, the exited state can transition back to the ground state by emitting a photon. This 
photon carries the energy from the transition. This is called a \textit{radiative decay}.
