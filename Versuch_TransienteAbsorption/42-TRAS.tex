\subsection*{Variation in Concentration}
For ZnTPP, different concentrations in BN were measured. From the theory, we expect an exponential decay of the concentration of the triplet 
\begin{equation}
    C_T(t) = C_T(0) \exp[-k_0t],
\end{equation}
with the initital concentration $C_T(0)$ and the decay rate $k_0$.
As the transient absorption $\Delta A(\tau)$ is proportional to $C_T$, we can fit an exponential decay to our data. Hereby, an offset was added to the decay function to correct any offset caused by e.g.~measuring methods. Data and fits are shown in fig.~\ref{fig:TRAS-Conc}.

It is clear, that higher maxima correspond to higher concentrations of ZnTPP. This aligns our expectations as a higher concentration leads to a bigger ammount of absorption. The lifetime $\tau_0$ can be calculated from 
\begin{equation}
    \tau_0 = \frac{1}{k_0}.
\end{equation}

The calculated lifetimes can be found in tab.~\ref{tab:lifetimesConc}.
