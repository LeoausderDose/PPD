\section{Schubert equation}
\label{sec:Schubert}

In this section the Schubert equation is introduced. 

The Schubert equation is a know relation for the film thickness while spin coating. The thickness 

\begin{equation}
    d = A \cdot (\frac{\SI{1950}{\per\minute}}{\omega})^\frac{1}{2} (\frac{c_0}{\SI{20}{\gram\per\liter}})(\frac{M_W}{\SI{100}{\kilo\gram\per \mol}})^\frac{1}{4}
\end{equation}
 with $\omega$ being the rotation speed, the polymer concentration $c_0$ of the initial solution and
 the molecular weight $M_W$. The scaling factor A depends on environmental parameters such as
 temperature and humidity.
