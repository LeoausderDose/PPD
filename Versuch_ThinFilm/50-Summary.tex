Creating thin films has become a important tequni
In this course we have learned, how thin filmes can be produced by spin coating. Using this technique two parameters are crutial for determining the thickness of the film: the rotaion speed and the concentration of the polymer in solution. In our measurements we could verify that the thickness increases with higher polymer concentration and decreasing rotation speed, according to Schubert's equation. The thickness was measured by white light reflectometry, using both reflection and transmission measurements.
