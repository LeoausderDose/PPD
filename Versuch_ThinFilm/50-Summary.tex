Creating thin films has become a important tecnique in industrial processing. 
In this practical course we have learned, how thin filmes can be produced by spin coating. We gained some good insight in the necessary processing steps and hand-on experience. Using this technique, two parameters are crutial for determining the thickness of the film: the rotaion speed and the concentration of the polymer in solution. In our measurements we could verify that the thickness increases with higher polymer concentration and decreasing rotation speed, according to Schubert's equation. The thickness was measured by white light reflectometry, using both reflection and transmission measurements. Hereby, we have discovered reflection measurements to be more accurate. Additionally, we determined the critical concentrations, where the polymer chains begin to interact with one another. This concentration was used to test various models of the polymer structure. In the end, we found a wormlike structure to be the most suitable.
