\section{Influence of the measurement method}
\label{sec:VglMeth}

In the following section the difference in results performing white light reflectometry in reflection
and transmission is analyzed and discussed.

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:SpecRefTrans}, the measured spectra in transmission and reflection show the same tendencies with regard to the position and number of minima and maxima. The films which are coated with a higher speed of rotation show less minima and maxima in the 
observed spectral range. This is an indicator for a lower layer thickness as can be concluded from equation \ref{eq:lamdathick}, as we expect since faster spinning in coating leads to 
bigger centrifugal forces on the solution during coating. This intuitive explanation is also reflected in the experimentally determined Schubert equation. 

When using the thickness output of the Nanocalc program, we observe a decrease in the coating thickness for lower concentrations of the coating solution as well as for higher rotational speeds as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:thickconcrpm}.

    \input{Bilder/Auswertung/VglMessmeth/VglMethErrorFrac.tex}
    \caption{The standard deviation divided by the fit error}
    \label{fig:errorFrac}

\end{figure}

Furthermore we determined the mean values and the standard deviation for every measurement on the same sample. To verify wether the is a 
linear connection between the two errors we plot the fraction of those two quantities as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:errorFrac}. We were not able to find a connection.
In our interpretation the deviations are not linked since the do not have the same origin. The standard deviation in film thickness is 
not an error of measurement but a real local variation of the film  thickness. The fit error in contrast is a real error. Therefore those two quantities do not seem to be linked. When
comparing the graphically as shown in Figure \ref{fig:FitFehlergegenStd}, we do not see any significant correlation.



To investigate this heterogeneity

\begin{equation}
    h = \frac{< d >}{std(d)}
\end{equation}

in more detail, we plot it against the thickness of the layer. As can be noted in Figure \ref{fig:thickheter}, the heterogeneity
increases for lower film thickness. The last point at \SI{0}{\nano\meter} has not to be taken into account since at this point the heterogeneity loses its meaning as all measurement 
return as thickness \SI{0}{\nano\meter}.
