As we as humanity are facing global warming and an increasing need for energy, solutions reconcile these opposing forces are urgently needed. Organic solar cells (OSCs) represent a promising solution due to their potential for large-scale production as a cost-effective and scalable energy source.
since they could a cheap and scalable energy source.

However, large scale production of organic solar cells (OSC) requires precise control of the manufacturing process. For this 
This necessitates inside into the properties of the film are essential. This experiment aims to determine one crucial property of the film -- its thickness -- using white light reflectrometry on polystyrene (PS) thin films.  By demonstrating this method, we aim to enhance our understanding of the technique, enabling its application to other, more complex material systems in the future.
